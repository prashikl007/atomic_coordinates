extracting atom co-ordinates from Protein Data Bank


Protein Data Bank is very important database, which contains information about protein of a sequence (either DNA or RNA).
This databank has information like, the molecules which forms the protein, co-ordinates of the atoms of molecules which specifies the placement of all those, which resembles  the structure of the protein, and hence we can learn about te structure of protein and the sequence.
